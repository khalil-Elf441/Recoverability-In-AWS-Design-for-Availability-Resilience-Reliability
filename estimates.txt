- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage :

In the event of a Single Availability Zone (AZ) outage in the active region, the Multi-AZ configuration of the MySQL database ensures minimal downtime.
The standby instance, located in the different AZ, is automatically promoted to the primary instance, reducing the Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
The Time Estimate: Typically within minutes.

- Minimum RTO for a single region outage :

If an entire region faces a meltdown, the region's read replica steps up, minimizing the Recovery Time Objective (RTO). 
A manual or automated DNS tweak and possible application adjustments are needed, but having a standby region significantly cuts downtime compared to having no backup region.
The Time Estimate: Potentially longer, likely within the range of minutes to hours depending on the complexity of the failover process and the need for DNS changes and application adjustments.


- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage :

For a Single AZ issue, Multi-AZ deployment ensures a low Recovery Point Objective (RPO), the data is mirrored in real-time between the primary database and its synchronous replica in another AZ. 
If something goes wrong in one AZ, the failover to the standby instance is seamless, One might lose only the latest committed transactions during this quick switch.
The Time Estimate: Near zero or minimal data loss due to synchronous replication.

- Minimum RPO for a single region outage :

The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) during a Single Region outage depends on the replication lag between the primary and the standby region's read replica.
AWS's asynchronous replication introduces a slight delay in data transfer between regions. 
The Time Estimate: Similar to RTO, as it depends on the replication lag between regions. Data loss may range from minimal to a few minutes.
